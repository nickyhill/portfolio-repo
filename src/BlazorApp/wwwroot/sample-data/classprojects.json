      "description": "Major Design Experience is a two-semester capstone where I am assigned a team and we must create a solution to a problem that a customer has come to us to solve. The project my team and I were asigned was a software based project to produce a Software Bill of Materials. We broke the project up into three major subsystems; backend, frontend, and database. The backend deals with the extraction and collection of assets which then stores them in a database that is used by the secure frontend to display specific information on a webserver. Me and another peer are tasked with the frontend development."
